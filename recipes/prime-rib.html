    <h2>How to Make the Perfect Prime Rib</h2>
    <p>If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, 
        perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. 
        Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at <strong>500 degrees F </strong>for exactly that many minutes. <i>(Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.)</i>Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. 
        Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!
